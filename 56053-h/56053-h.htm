<h2 id="memoir-of-the-author.">Memoir of the Author.</h2>
<p>The following is the substance of an article published in the “New England Historical and Genealogical Register,” for April, 1863, written by John Ward Dean, Esq., of Boston:</p>
<p>A century ago no poetry was more popular in New England than Wigglesworth’s <em>Day of Doom</em>. Francis Jenks, Esq., in an article in the <em>Christian Examiner</em> for Nov., 1828, speaks of it as “a work which was taught our fathers with their catechisms, and which many an aged person with whom we are acquainted can still repeat, though they may not have met with a copy since they were in leading strings; a work that was hawked about the country, printed on sheets like common ballads; and, in fine, a work which fairly represents the prevailing theology of New England at the time it was written, and which Mather thought might, ‘perhaps, find our children till the Day itself arrives.’”</p>
<p>The popularity of Wigglesworth dated from the appearance of his poem, and continued for more than a century. Expressing in earnest words the theology which they believed, and picturing in lively colors the terrors of the judgment day and the awful wrath of an offended God, it commended itself to those zealous Puritans, who had little taste for lofty rhyme or literary excellence. The imaginative youth devoured its horrors with avidity, and shuddered at its fierce denunciation of sin. In the darkness of night he saw its frightful forms arise, and was thus driven to seek the “ark of safety” from the wrath of Jehovah. For the last century, however, the reputation of the <em>Day of Doom</em> has waned, and few at the present day know it except by reputation.</p>
<p>The author of this book, whose wand had summoned up such images of terror, was neither a cynic nor a misanthrope, though sickness, which generally brings out these dispositions where they exist, had long been his doom. His attenuated frame and feeble health were joined to genial manners; and, though subject to fits of despondency, he seems generally to have maintained a cheerful temper, so much so that some of his friends believed his ills to be imaginary.</p>
<p>Rev. Michael Wigglesworth was born October 28, 1631, probably in Yorkshire, England. He was brought to this country in 1638, being then seven years old, but in what ship we are not informed. His father, Edward Wigglesworth, was one of those resolute Puritans who, with their families, found an asylum where they could enjoy their religion without molestation in our then New England wilderness, the distance of which from their English homes can hardly be appreciated now. Here they suffered the severe hardships of a rigorous climate, the fearful dangers from savage tribes around them, while uniting to build up villages which are now cities, and which still retain some of the characteristics of their Puritan founders. The determined purpose and strength of principle that conquered every obstacle was a school of severe training for the children of that period. It was natural that a father who had endured so much for conscience’ sake should desire to see his only son a clergyman; and, although the father’s means were not large, the son was devoted to the ministry and given a thorough education. Michael, after nearly three years of preparatory studies, entered Harvard College in 1647. Here he had the good fortune to have for a tutor the excellent Jonathan Mitchell, “the glory of the college,” and famous as a preacher. The friendship here begun appears to have continued after both had left the college walls. Probably the eight stanzas “on the following work and its author,” signed J. Mitchel, were written by that tutor and preacher, who was a native of Yorkshire, the county in which Wigglesworth is believed to have been born.</p>
<p>In 1651 Mr. Wigglesworth graduated, and was soon after appointed a tutor in the College. Some of his pupils were men of note in their day. Among them were. Rev. Shubael Dummer, of York, Me.; Rev. John Eliot, of Newton; and Rev. Samuel Torry, of Weymouth; but the chief of them, it will be admitted, was Rev. Increase Mather, D.D., pastor of the second church in Boston, and for sixteen years president of Harvard College. That the tutor was faithful to his trust, we have evidence from the sketch of the funeral sermon appended to this work, preached by Rev. Cotton Mather, D.D., son of Increase, who probably derived his information from his father.</p>
<p>While a tutor, he prepared himself for the ministry, and before his father’s death he had preached several times. He was invited, probably in the autumn of 1654, to settle at Malden, as the successor of Rev. Marmaduke Matthews, but owing to long-continued sickness was not ordained there till 1656. The precise date of his ordination is not known, but it must have been subsequent to August 25, 1656, for his letter of dismission from the church at Cambridge bears that date. This letter, addressing the “Church of Christ at Maldon,” states that “the good hand of Divine Providence hath so disposed that our beloved and highly esteemed brother, Mr. Wigglesworth, hath his residence and is employed in the good work of ye Lord amongst you, and hath cause to desire of us Letters Dismissive to your church, in order to his joining as a member with you.”</p>
<p>The ill health which had delayed his ordination at Malden returned soon after his settlement there, and interrupted his ministry several years. He took a voyage to Bermuda, sailing Sept. 23, 1663, and being absent about seven months and a half. But the tedious and stormy voyage seems to have impaired his health so much that the change of climate afforded him little relief, and he returned much discouraged. He met with a very cordial welcome from his friends and parishioners.</p>
<p>While he was thus withheld from his ministry, he employed his time in literary labors. His <em>Day of Doom</em> was published about 1662, the year before his voyage to Bermuda. The first edition consisting of 1,800 copies, was sold, with some profit to the author, within a year, which considering the population and wealth of New England at that time, shows almost as remarkable a popularity as that of <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>.</p>
<p>While absent on his voyage in search of health, Dec. 9, 1663, Rev. Benjamin Bunker was ordained pastor of the church at Malden. It seems that a distinction was observed at this time in New England between pastor and teacher. Wigglesworth calls Bunker “pastor” in some verses composed on his death, while on the title-page of this, work he calls himself “teacher.” After Wigglesworth became sole minister, he was probably considered the pastor. Bunker held this office over six years, till his death, Feb. 3, 1669-70; In the elegy on the death of his colleague, Wigglesworth highly extols Bunker’s piety and usefulness. The next colleague of our author was Bev. Benjamin Blackman, settled about 1674. He supplied the desk four years and upward. and left in the year 1679. His next colleague was Rev. Thomas Cheever, son of his early teacher, the celebrated New England schoolmaster, Ezekiel Cheever, author of <em>Latin Accidence</em>. These three ministers were all educated at Harvard College, Bunker having graduated in 1658, Blackman in 1663, and Cheever in 1677. Mr. Cheever began to preach at Maiden Feb. 14, 1679-80, was ordained July 27, 1681, and was dismissed May 20, 1686.</p>
<p>Wigglesworth, though long prevented by sickness from officiating, never resigned his ministerial charge, as appears from a letter which he addressed to Samuel Sprague, July 22, 1687. He was now left alone as minister of the church. He had, however, recovered his health in a measure about this time, which had suffered for nearly twenty years, and for the remainder of his life he continued in public usefulness.</p>
<p>He died on Sunday morning, June 10, 1705, in the 74th year of his age. The epitaph on the last page of this work is believed to have been written by Cotton Mather, as it appears in the appendix to his funeral sermon as by “one that had been gratified by his <em>Meat out of the Eater</em> and <em>Day of Doom</em>.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wigglesworth had at least three wives: Mary, daughter of Humphrey Reyner, of Rowley; Martha, whose maiden name was probably Mudge; and Sybil, widow of Dr. Jonathan Avery, of Dedham, and daughter of Nathaniel Sparhawk, of Cambridge.</p>
<p>By his first wife he had (1) <em>Mercy</em> b. Feb., 1655-6; m. 1st, [Samuel?] Brackenbury, by whom she had at least one son, William; m. 2d, [Rev. Samuel.?] Belcher.</p>
<p>By his second wife, Martha, who d. 11th Sept., 1690, a. 28, he had:— (2) <em>Abigail</em>, b. 20th March, 1681; m. Samuel Tappan, 23d Dec, 1700;— (3) <em>Mary</em>, b. 21st Sept., 1682 ; unm. in 1708;— (4) <em>Martha</em>, b. 21st Dec., 1683; m. Wheeler;— (5) <em>Esther</em>, b. 16th April, 1685; m. 1st, John Sewall, June 8, 1708, who d. 1711; m. 2d, Abraham Tappan, Oct. 21, 1713;— (6) Dorothy, b. 22d Feb., 1687-88; m. 2d June, 1709, James Upham;— (7) Rev. Samuel, b. 4th Feb., 1689-90, d. 3d Sept., 1768. By his third wife, Sybil, who d. 6th Aug., 1708, a. 53, he had:— (8) Prof. <em>Edward</em>, D.D., b. about 1692, d. Jan. 16, 1765.</p>
<p>Rev. Samuel Wigglesworth, the elder son, was settled in Hamilton Parish, in Ipswich, Mass., in 1714. He m. 1st, Mary, dau. of John Brintnal, of Winnisimmet, 30th June, 1715, who d. June 6, 1723, a. 28, having borne him four children, Mary, Michael, Martha, and Phebe. He m. March 12, 1730, Martha Brown, and had nine children.</p>
<p>Edward Wigglesworth, D.D., the younger son, took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1710, and applied himself to the study of Divinity. He preached for some time in different parishes, and in 1722 was installed Hollis Professor of Divinity of Harvard College. Not long afterward he was chosen one of the fellows of the corporation. He left an only son, who succeeded him as Hollis Professor in the same college, and an only surviving daughter, who married Prof. Sewall.</p>
<p>The following are the various editions of the <em>Day of Doom</em>, so far as we have been able to ascertain:</p>
<p>The first edition was published in 1661 or 1662, and the second four years after. These facts are obtained from memoranda by the author, which are printed in the Historical Magazine for December, 1863. An edition was printed in London, England, without the author’s name, in 1673. This was, probably, the third impression; the date of the fourth is unknown. The fifth edition is said to have been published in 1701. Mr. Dean has made diligent search and repeated inquiries, but can only find two or three copies of the edition of 1673, and several fragments which must have been parts of some of the other editions.</p>
<p>There was an edition published at Newcastle, in England, in 1711. The next edition was published in 1715, called “the 6th edition, enlarged, with Scripture and marginal notes”—“printed by John Allen, for Benjamin Eliot, at his shop in King street.” From this edition, which was evidently the seventh, the present one is reprinted, being carefully compared with that of 1673. Another edition appeared in 1751, “Printed and sold by Thomas Fleet, at the Heart and Crown, in Cornhill,” Boston. The next edition appeared in 1811, “Published by E. Little &amp; Company, Newburyport,” Mass. The last edition, prior to the present, was published in Boston in 1828, by Charles Ewer.</p>
<p>Besides the <em>Day of Doom</em> Mr. Wigglesworth published, in 1669, “Meat out of the Eater; or, Meditations concerning the necessity and usefulness of Afflictions unto God’s Children.” The “fourth edition” appeared in 1689, and subsequent editions in 1717 and 1770. In 1686 he preached an Election Sermon, which was printed by the colony. Among his unpublished writings is a poem entitled “God’s Controversy with New England, written in the time of the great Drought, Anno 1662. By a lover of New England’s prosperity.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wigglesworth borrowed little from other poets, and what he borrowed was probably from the commentaries and theological treatises with which his library abounded, rather than from the poets. Not that his style is wholly prosaic, for there are passages in his writings that are truly poetical, both in thought and expression, and which show that he was capable of attaining a higher position as a poet than can now be claimed for him. The roughness of his verses was surely not owing to carelessness or indolence, for neither of them was characteristic of the man. The true explanation may be, that he sacrificed his poetical taste to his theology, and that, for the sake of inculcating sound doctrine, he was willing to write in halting numbers.</p>
<p>The author of the <em>Day of Doom</em>, belonging to the straitest sect of Puritans, was, like many others of that sect, a man of generous feeling toward his fellows. Rev. Dr. Peabody calls him “a man of the beatitudes.” Obedience to the supreme law gave a heavenly lustre to his example and a sweet fragrance to his memory. The clergy of his day possessed a deep religious earnestness and a fervent piety. They were Bible students and men of prayer. Even many who consider them erroneous in doctrine, are willing to allow that they were strict in morals; that, if they were wrong in faith, they were right in life; that, if their creed was opaque, their hearts were luminous; and that, if their vision did not discern the additional light which the saintly Robinson had prophesied was yet to break forth from God’s Word, they sincerely accepted the light they saw. They were patient, hopeful, humble, believing, faithful. They stood on a higher plane than their successors, and exercised a proportionally higher power over their hearers. Their people revered them, were constant in attendance on their services, and submitted gladly to their sway.</p>
<h2 id="autobiography">Autobiography</h2>
<p>I was born of Godly Parents, that feared ye Lord greatly, even from their youth, but in an ungodly Place, where ye generality of ye people rather derided than imitated their piety; in a place where, to my knowledge, their children had Learnt wickedness betimes; in a place that was consumed with fire in a great part of it, after God had brought them out of it. These godly parents of mine meeting with opposition and persecution for Religion, because they went from their own Parish church to hear ye word and Receiv ye Lords supper &amp;c, took up resolutions to pluck up their stakes and remove themselves to New England: and accordingly they did so, Leaving dear Relations, friends and acquaintance, their native Land, a new built house, a flourishing Trade, to expose themselves to ye hazzard of ye seas, and to ye Distressing difficulties of a howling wilderness, that they might enjoy Liberty of Conscience and Christ in his ordinances. And the Lord brought them hither and Landed them at Charlstown, after many difficulties and hazzards, and me along with them, being then a child not full seven years old. After about 7 weeks stay at Charlstown, my parents removed again by sea to New Haven in ye month of October. In our passage thither we were in great Danger by a storm which drove us upon a Beach of sand where we lay beating til another Tide fetcht us off; but God carried us to our port in safety. Winter approaching we dwelt in a cellar partly under ground covered with earth the first winter. But I remember that one great rain, brake in upon us and drencht me so in my bed, being asleep, that I fell sick upon it; but ye Lord in mercy spar’d my life and restored my health. When ye next summer was come I was sent to school to Mr. Ezekiel Cheever, who at that time taught school in his own house, and under him in a year or two I profited so much through ye blessing of God, that I began to make Latin and to get forward apace. But God who is infinitely wise and absolutely soverain, and gives no account concerning any of his proceedings, was pleased about this time to visit my father with Lameness which grew upon him more and more to his dying Day, though he liv’d under it 13 years. He wanting help was fain to take me off from school to follow other employments for ye space of 3 or 4 years, until I had lost all that I had gained in the Latin Tongue. But when I was now in my fourteenth year, my Father, who I suppose was not wel satisfied in keeping me from Learning whereto I had been designed from my infancy, and not judging me fit for husbandry, sent me to school again, though at that time I had little or no disposition to it, but I was willing to submit to his authority therein and accordingly I went to school under no small disadvantage and discouragement, seing those that were far inferior to me, by my discontinuance now gotten far before me. But in a little time it appeared to be of God, who was pleased to facilitate my work and bless my studies that I soon recovered what I had lost, and gained a great deal more, so that in 2 years and 3 quarters I was judged fit for ye Colledge and thither I was sent far from my parents and acquaintance among strangers. But when father and mother both forsook me then ye Lord took care of me. It was an act of great self denial in my father that notwithstanding his own lameness and great weakness of Body which required ye service and helpfulness of a son, and having but one son to be ye staff of his age and supporter of his weakness, he would yet for my good, be content to deny himself of that comfort and Assistance I might have Lent him. It was also an evident proof of a strong Faith in him, in that he durst adventure to send me to ye Colledge, though his estate was but small and little enough to maintain himself and small family left at home. And God let him Live to see how acceptable to himself this service was in giving up his only son to ye Lord and bringing him up to Learning; especially ye Lively actings of his faith and self denial herein. For first, notwithstanding his great weakness of body, yet he Lived til I was so far brought up as that I was called to be a fellow of ye Colledge and improved in Publick servdce there, and until I had preached several Times; yea and more than so, he Lived to see and hear what God had done for my soul in turning me from Darkness to light and from ye power of Sathan unto God, which filled his heart full of joy and thankfulness beyond what can be expressed. And for his outward estate, that was so far from being sunk by what he spent from year to year upon my education, that in 6 years time it was plainly doubled, which himself took great notice of, and spake of it to myself and others, to ye praise of God, with Admiration and thankfulness. And after he had lived under great and sore affliction for ye space of 13 years a pattern of faith, patience, humility, and heavenly mindedness, having done his work in my education and receiv’d an answer to his prayers, God took him to his Heavenly Rest, where he is now reaping ye fruits of his Labors. When I came first to ye Colledge, I had indeed enjoyed ye benefit of Religious and strict education, and God in his mercy and pitty kept me from scandalous sins before I came thither and after I came there, but alas I had a naughty vile heart and was acted by corrupt nature, therefore could propound no Right and noble ends, but acted from self and for self. I was indeed studious and strove to outdoe my compeers, but it was for honour and applause and preferment and such poor Beggarly ends. Thus I had my Ends and God had his Ends far differing from mine, yet it pleased him to Bless my studies, and to make me grow in Knowledge both in ye tongues and inferior Arts and also in Divinity. But when I had been there about three years and a half; God in his Love and Pitty to my soul wrought a great change in me, both in heart and Life, and from that time forward I learnt to study with God and for God. And whereas before that, I had thoughts of applying myself to ye study and Practice of Physick, I wholy laid aside those thoughts, and did chuse to serve Christ in ye work of ye ministry if he would please to fit me for it and to accept of my service in that great work.</p>
<p>Note.—In the foregoing Autobiography the original spelling is retained. In the following poems the spelling is modernized. The use of the acute accent (’) to indicate the former pronunciation of the final <em>ed</em> as a separate syllable will be obvious; in other exceptional cases the old apostrophe is retained. In a few instances the termination <em>tion</em> is divided by a hyphen, to indicate its pronunication as two syllables (<em>she</em>-on). The modern double commas are also used to mark quotations.</p>

<p>Reader, I am a fool,<br />
And have adventuréd<br />
To play the fool this once for Christ,<br />
The more his fame to spread.<br />
If this my foolishness<br />
Help thee to be more wise,<br />
I have attainéd what I seek.<br />
And what I only prize.</p>
<p>Thou wonderest, perhaps,<br />

Who to the Pulpit dwell so nigh,<br />

The God of Heaven knows<br />
What grief to me it is,<br />
To be withheld from serving Christ;<br />
No sorrow like to this.</p>
<p>This is the sorest pain<br />
That T have felt or feel;<br />
Yet have I stood some shocks that might<br />
Make stronger men to reel.<br />
I find more true delight<br />
In serving of the Lord,<br />
Than all the good things upon Earth,<br />
Without it, can afford.</p>
<p>And could my strength endure<br />
That work I count so dear,<br />
Not all the Riches of Peru<br />
Should hire me to forbear.<br />
But I’m a Prisoner,<br />
Under a heavy Chain;<br />
Almighty God’s afflicting hand<br />
Doth me by force restrain.</p>
<p>Yet some (<em>I know</em>) do judge<br />
Mine inability<br />
To come abroad and do Christ’s work.<br />
To be Melancholly;<br />
And that I’m not so weak<br />
As I myself conceit:<br />
But who in other things have found<br />
Me so conceited yet?</p>
<p>Or who of all my Friends<br />
That have my trials seen,<br />
Can tell the time in sevén years<br />
When I have dumpish been?<br />
Some think my voice is strong,<br />
Most times when I do Preach;<br />
But ten days after, what I feel<br />
And suffer few can reach.</p>
<p>My prison’d thoughts break forth,<br />
When open’d is the door.<br />
With greater force and violence,<br />
And strain my voice the more.<br />
But vainly do they tell<br />
That I am growing stronger,<br />
Who hear me speak in half an hour,<br />
Till I can speak no longer.</p>
<p>Some for because they see not<br />
My clieerfulness to fail,<br />
Nor that I am disconsolate,<br />
Do think I nothing ail.<br />
If they had borne my griefs,<br />
Their courage might have fail’d them,<br />
And all the Town (perhaps) have known<br />
(Once and again) what ail’d them.</p>
<p>But why should I complain<br />
That have so good a God,<br />
That doth mine heart with comfort till<br />
Ev’n whilst I feel his Rod?<br />
In God I have been strong,<br />
But wearied and worn out.<br />
And joy’d in him, when twenty woes<br />
Assail’d me round about.</p>
<p>Nor speak I this to boast.<br />
But make Apology<br />
For mine own self, and answer those<br />
That fail in Charity.<br />
I am, alas! as frail.<br />

As most that tread upon the ground,<br />
And have as bad a nature.</p>
<p>Let God be magnified.<br />
Whose everlasting strength<br />
Upholds me under sufferings<br />
Of more than ten years’ length;<br />
Through whose Almighty pow’r<br />
Although I am surrounded<br />
With sorrows more than can be told,<br />
Yet am I not confounded.</p>
<p>For his dear sake have I<br />

<p>I would, but ah! my strength.<br />
When triéd, proves so small,<br />

Weak heads, and hands, and states,<br />
Great things cannot produce ;<br />
And therefore I this little Piece<br />

There’s nothing in ’t can do thee hurt,<br />

<p>The God of Heaven grant<br />
These Lines so well to speed,<br />

And make the Judge thy Friend;<br />
So shalt thou be assuréd of<br />

<p><em>O Dearest, Dread, most glorious King!</em><br />
<em>I’ll of thy justest Judgments sing:</em><br />
<em>Do thou my head and heart inspire,</em><br />
<em>To Sing aright, as I desire.</em><br />
<em>Thee, thee alone I’ll invocate,</em><br />

<em>And yet they worship worse than naught.</em><br />
<em>Oh! what a deal of Blasphemy</em><br />
<em>And Heathenish Impiety</em><br />
<em>In Christian Poets may be found,</em><br />
<em>Where Heathen gods with praise are crown’d!</em><br />
<em>They make Jehovah to stand by</em><br />
<em>Till Juno, Venus, Mercury,</em><br />
<em>With frowning Mars, and thund’ring Jove,</em><br />
<em>Rule Earth below, and Heav’n ahove.</em><br />
<em>But I have learn’d to pray to none,</em><br />
<em>Save unto God in Christ alone.</em><br />
<em>Nor will I laud, no, not in jest,</em><br />
<em>That which I know God doth detest.</em><br />
<em>I reckon it a damning evil.</em><br />
<em>To give God’s Praises to the Devil.</em><br />
<em>Thou, Christ, art he to whom I pray;</em><br />
<em>Thy Glory fain I would display.</em><br />
<em>Oh! guide me by thy sacred Sprite,</em><br />
<em>So to indite, and so to write.</em><br />
<em>That I thine holy Name may praise.</em><br />
<em>And teach the Sons of Men thy ways.</em></p>

<h2 id="a-short-discourse-on-eternity.">A Short Discourse On Eternity.</h2>
<p>What mortal man can with a Span<br />
  mete out Eternity?<br />
Or fathom it by depth of Wit,<br />
  or strength of Memory?<br />
The lofty Sky is not so high,<br />
  Hell’s depth to this is small;<br />
The World so wide is but a stride,<br />
  comparéd therewithal.</p>
<p>It is a main great Oce-an<br />
  withouten bank or bound,<br />
A deep Abyss, wherein there is<br />
  no bottom to be found.<br />
This World hath stood now since the Flood,<br />
  four thousand years well near,<br />
And had before enduréd more<br />
  than sixteen hundred year.</p>
<p>But what’s the time from the World’s prime,<br />
  unto this present day,<br />
If we thereby Eternity<br />
  to measure should essay?<br />
The whole duration since the Creation,<br />
  though long, yet is more little.<br />
If placed by Eternity,<br />
  than is the smallest tittle.</p>
<p>Tell every Star both near and far,<br />
  in Heav’n’s bright Canopy<br />
That doth appear throughout the year<br />
  of high or low degree:<br />
Tell every Tree that thou canst see<br />
  in this vast Wilderness,<br />
Up in the Woods, down by the Floods,<br />
  in thousand miles Progress:</p>
<p>The sum is vast, yet not so vast<br />
  but that thou may’st go on<br />
To multiply the leaves thereby,<br />
  that hang those Trees upon:<br />
Add thereunto the Drops that thou<br />
  imaginest to be<br />
In April Show’rs, that bring forth Flow’rs<br />
  and blossoms plenteously:</p>
<p>Number the Fowls and living Souls<br />
  that through the Air do fly,<br />
The wingéd Hosts in all their Coasts<br />
  beneath the starry Sky:<br />
Count all the Grass as thou dost pass<br />
  through many a pasture-land,<br />
And dewy Drops that on the tops<br />
  of Herbs and Plants do stand:</p>
<p>Number the Sand upon the Strand,<br />
  and atoms of the Air;<br />
And do thy best on Man and Beast,<br />
  to reckon every Hair:<br />
Take all the Dust, if so thou lust,<br />
  and add to thine Account:<br />
Yet shall the Years of Sinners’ tears,<br />
  the Number far surmount.</p>
<p>Naught join’d to naught can ne’er make aught,<br />
  nor Cyphers make a Sum;<br />
Nor things finite, to infinite<br />
  by multiplying come:<br />
A Cockle-shell may serve as well<br />
  to lade the Ocean dry<br />
As finite things and reckonings<br />
  to bound Eternity.</p>
<p>Oh happy they that live for aye,<br />
  with Christ in Heav’n above!<br />
Who know withal that nothing shall<br />
  deprive them of his love.<br />
<em>Eternity, Eternity!</em><br />
  Oh! were it not for thee,<br />
The Saints in bliss and happiness<br />
  could never happy be.</p>
<p>For if they were in any fear<br />
  that this their joy might cease,<br />
It would annoy (if not destroy)<br />
  and interrupt their peace.<br />
But being sure it shall endure<br />
  so long as God shall live;<br />
The thoughts of this, unto their bliss,<br />
  do full perfection give.</p>
<p>Cheer up ye Saints amidst your wants<br />
  and sorrows many a one;<br />
Lift up the head, shake off all dread,<br />
  and moderate your moan.<br />
Your sufferings and evil things<br />
  will suddenly be past;<br />
Your sweet Fruitions and blessed Visions,<br />
  for evermore shall last.</p>
<p>Lament and mourn you that must burn<br />
  amidst those flaming Seas:<br />
If once you come to such a doom,<br />
  for ever farewell ease.<br />
O sad estate and desperate,<br />
  that never can be mended,<br />
Until God’s Will shall change, or till<br />
  Eternity be ended!</p>
<p>If any one this Questi-on<br />
  shall unto me propound:<br />
What! have the years of Sinners’ tears<br />
  no limits or no bound?<br />
It kills our heart to think of smart,<br />
  and pains that last for ever;<br />
And hear of fire that shall expire,<br />
  or be extinguish’d never,</p>
<p>I’ll answer make (and let them take<br />
  my words as I intend them;<br />
For this is all the Cordi-al<br />
  that here I have to lend them:)<br />
When Heav’n shall cease to flow with peace<br />
  and all felicity.<br />
Then Hell may cease to be the place<br />
  of Woe and Misery.</p>
<p>When Heav’n is Hell, when Ill is Well,<br />
  when Virtue turns to Vice;<br />
When Wrong is Right, when Dark is Light,<br />
  when Naught is of great price;<br />
Then may the years of Sinners’ tears<br />
  and sufferings expire.<br />
And all the Hosts of damnéd Ghosts<br />
  escape out of Hell-fire.</p>
<p>When Christ above shall cease to love,<br />
  when God shall cease to reign<br />
And be no more as heretofore<br />
  the World’s great Sovéreign;<br />
Or not be just, or favor lust,<br />
  or in Men’s sins delight;<br />
Then wicked men (and not till then)<br />
  to Heav’n may take their flight.</p>
<p>When God’s great Power shall be brought lower,<br />
  by foreign Puissance,<br />
Or be decay’d and weaker made<br />
  through Time’s continuance;<br />
When drowsiness shall him oppress,<br />
  and lay him fast asleep,<br />
Then sinful men may break their pen,<br />
  and out of Prison creep.</p>
<p>When those in Glory shall be right sorry<br />
  they may not change their place,<br />
And wish to dwell with those in Hell,<br />
  never to see Christ’s face;<br />
Then those in pain may freedom gain<br />
  and be with Glory dight:<br />
Then Hellish fiends may be Christ’s Friends,<br />
  and Heirs of Heaven hight.</p>
<p>Then, ah! poor men! What! not till then?<br />
  No, not an hour before;<br />
For God is just, and therefore must<br />
  torment them evermore.<br />
<strong>Eternity! Eternity!</strong><br />
  thou mak’st hard hearts to bleed:<br />
The thoughts of thee in misery,<br />
  do make men wail indeed.</p>
<p>When they remind what’s still behind<br />
  and ponder this word NEVER,<br />
That they must there be made to bear<br />
  God’s Vengéance for EVER:<br />
The thought of this more bitter is<br />
  than all they feel beside;<br />
Yet what they feel, nor heart of steel,<br />
  nor flesh of brass can bide.</p>
<p>To lie in woe and undergo<br />
  the direful pains of Hell,<br />
And know withal, that there they shall<br />
  for aye and ever dwell;<br />
And that they are from rest as far<br />
  when fifty thousand year,<br />
Twice told, are spent in punishment,<br />
  as when they first came there;</p>
<p>This, oh! this makes Hell’s fiery flakes<br />
  much more intolerable;<br />
This makes frail wights and damnéd sprites<br />
  to bear their plagues unable.<br />
This makes men bite, for fell despite,<br />
  their very tongues in twain;<br />
This makes them roar for great horror,<br />
  and trebleth all their pain.</p>
<h2 id="a-postscript-unto-the-reader.">A Postscript Unto The Reader.</h2>
<p>And now, good Reader, I return again<br />
To talk with thee who hast been at the pain<br />
To read throughout and heed what went before;<br />
And unto thee I’ll speak a little more.<br />
Give ear I pray thee unto what I say,<br />
That God may hear thy voice another day.<br />
Thou hast a Soul, my Friend, and so have I,<br />
To save or lose; a Soul that cannot die;<br />
A Soul of greater price than Gold or Gems;<br />
A Soul more worth than Crowns and Diadems;<br />
A Soul at first created like its Maker,<br />
And of God’s Image made to be partaker:<br />
Upon the wings of noblest Faculties,<br />
Taught for to soar above the Starry Skies,<br />
And not to rest, until it understood<br />
Itself possesséd of the chiefest Good.<br />
And since the Fall thy Soul retaineth still<br />
Those faculties of Reason and of Will,<br />
But oh! how much deprav’d and out of frame,<br />
As if they were some other’s, not the same!<br />
Thine Understanding dismally benighted,<br />
And Reason’s eye in Spir’tual things dim-sighted,<br />
Or else stark blind; thy Will inclin’d to evil.<br />
And nothing else; a slave unto the Devil;<br />
That loves to live, and liveth to transgress.<br />
But shuns the way of God and Holiness.<br />
All thine Affections are disorderéd,<br />
And thus by headstrong Passions are misled.<br />
What need I tell thee of thy crooked way,<br />
And many wicked wand’rings every day?<br />
Or that thine own transgressi-ons are more<br />
In number than the sands upon the Shore?<br />
Thou art a lump of wickedness become,<br />
And may’st with horror think upon thy Doom,<br />
Until thy Soul be washéd in the flood<br />
Of Christ’s most dear, soul-cleansing, precious Blood.<br />
That, that alone can do away thy sin,<br />
Which thou wert born and hast long livéd in;<br />
That, only that can pacify God’s wrath,<br />
If apprehended by a lively Faith,<br />
Now whilst the day and means of Grace do last,<br />
Before the opportunity be past.</p>
<p>But if, man, thou liv’st a Christless creature,<br />
And Death surprise thee in a state of nature,<br />
(As who can tell but that may be thy case?)<br />
How wilt thou stand before the Judge’s face,<br />
When he shall be reveal’d in flaming fire.<br />
And come to pay ungodly men their hire.<br />
To execute due vengeance upon those<br />
That knew him not, or that had been his foes?<br />
What wilt thou answer unto his demands,<br />
When he requires a reason at thy hands,<br />
Of all the things that thou hast said or done.<br />
Or left undone, or set thine heart upon?<br />
When he shall thus with thee expostulate:<br />
“What cause hadst thou thy Maker for to hate;<br />
To take up arms against thy Sovéreign,<br />
And enmity against him to maintain?<br />
What injury hath God Almighty done thee?<br />
What good hath he withheld that might have won thee?<br />
What evil, or injustice hast thou found<br />
In him that might unto thine hurt redound?<br />
If neither felt nor fearéd injury<br />
Hath movéd thee to such hostility,<br />
What made thee then the Fountain to forsake,<br />
And unto broken Pits thyself betake?<br />
What reason hadst thou to dishonor God,<br />
Who thee with Mercies never ceas’d to load?<br />
Because the Lord was good hast thou been evil,<br />
And taken part against him with the Devil?<br />
For all his cost to pay him with despite,<br />
And all his love with hatred to requite?<br />
Is this the fruit of God’s great patience,<br />
To wax more bold in disobedience?<br />
To kick against the bowels of his Love?<br />
Is this aright his Bounty to improve?<br />
Stand still, ye Heav’ns, and be astonishéd,<br />
That God by man should thus be injuréd!<br />
Give ear, Earth, and tremble at the sin<br />
Of those that thine Inhabitants have been!<br />
But thou, vile wretch, hast added unto all<br />
Thine other faults and facts so criminal,<br />
The damning sin of willful unbelief;<br />
Of all Transgressors hast thou been the chief.<br />
Yet when time was thou might’st have been set free<br />
From Sin and Wrath and punishment by me;<br />
But thou would’st not accept of Gospel Grace,<br />
Nor on my terms Eternal Life embrace.<br />
As if that all thy breaches of God’s Law<br />
Were not enough upon thy head to draw<br />
Eternal Wrath, thou hast despis’d a Savior,<br />
Rejected me, and trampled on my favor.<br />
How oft have I stood knocking at thy door,<br />
And been denied entrance evermore?<br />
How often hath my Spirit been withstood,<br />
When as I sent him to have done thee good?<br />
Thou hast no need of any one to plead<br />
Thy cause or for thy Soul to intercede:<br />
Plead for thyself, if thou hast aught to say,<br />
And pay thy forfeiture without delay.<br />
Behold thou dost ten thousand Talents owe;<br />
Pay thou the debt or else to Prison go.“</p>
<p>Think, think, man, when Christ shall thus unfold<br />
Thy secret guilt, and make thee to behold<br />
The ugly face of all thy sinful errors,<br />
And fill thy soul with his amazing terrors,<br />
And let thee see the flaming Pit of Hell,<br />
Where all that have no part in him shall dwell;<br />
When he shall thus expostulate the case,<br />
How canst thou bear to look him in the face?<br />
What wilt thou do without an Advocate,<br />
Or plead, when thus thy state is desperate?<br />
Dost think to put him off with fair pretenses?<br />
Or wilt thou hide and cover thine offenses?<br />
Can anything from him concealéd be,<br />
Who doth the hidden things of darkness see?<br />
Art thou of force his Power to withstand?<br />
Canst thou by might escape out of his hand?<br />
Dost thou intend to run out of his sight,<br />
And save thyself from punishment by flight?<br />
Or wilt thou be eternally accurst,<br />
And ’bide his Vengeance, let him do his worst?<br />
Oh! who can bear his indignation’s heat?<br />
Or ’bide the pains of Hell which are so great?</p>
<p>If, then, thou neither canst his Wrath endure,<br />
Nor any ransom after death procure;<br />
If neither Cries nor Tears can move his heart<br />
To pardon thee or mitigate thy smart,<br />
But unto Hell thou must perforce be sent,<br />
With dismal horror and astonishment,<br />
Consider, O my Friend, what cause thou hast,<br />
With fear and trembling (while as yet thou may’st),<br />
To lay to heart thy sin and misery,<br />
And to make out after the Remedy.<br />
Consider well the greatness of thy danger,<br />
O Child of wrath, and object of God’s anger.<br />
Thou hangest over the Infernal Pit,<br />
By one small thread, and car’st not thou a whit?<br />
There’s but a step between thy Soul and Death;<br />
Nothing remains but stopping of thy breath,<br />
(Which may be done to-morrow, or before)<br />
And then thou art undone forevermore.<br />
Let this awaken thy security,<br />
And make thee look about thee speedily.</p>
<p>How canst thou rest an hour or sleep a night,<br />
Or in thy creature-comforts take delight?<br />
Or with vain Toys thyself forgetful make<br />
How near thou art unto the burning Lake?<br />
How canst thou live without tormenting fears?<br />
How canst thou hold from weeping floods of tears?<br />
Yea, tears of blood, I might almost have said,<br />
If such-like tears could from thine eyes be shed.<br />
To gain the world what will it profit thee,<br />
And lose thy soul and self eternally?<br />
Eternity on one small point dependeth;<br />
The man is lost that this short life misspendeth.<br />
For as the Tree doth fall, right so it lies,<br />
And man continues in what state he dies.<br />
Who happy die shall happy rise again;<br />
Who curséd die shall curséd still remain.<br />
If under Sin and Wrath Death leaves thee bound,<br />
At Judgment under Wrath thou shalt be found;<br />
And then woe woe that ever thou wert born,<br />
O wretched man, of Heav’n and Earth forlorn!<br />
Consider this, all ye that God forget,<br />
Who all his threatenings at naught do set,<br />
Lest into pieces he begin to tear<br />
Your souls, and there be no deliverer.</p>
<p>O you that now sing care and fear away,<br />
Think often of the formidable Day,<br />
Wherein the Heavens with a mighty noise.<br />
And with a hideous, heart-confounding voice<br />
Shall pass away, together being roll’d,<br />
As men are wont their garments up to fold;<br />
When th’ Elements with fervent heat shall melt,<br />
And living Creatures in the same shall swelt.<br />
And altogether in those flames expire,<br />
Which set the Earth’s Foundati-ons on fire.<br />
Oh! what amazements will your hearts be in,<br />
And how will you to curse yourselves begin.<br />
For all your damned sloth and negligence,<br />
And unbelief and gross Impenitence,<br />
When you shall hear that dreadful Sentence pass’d,<br />
That all the wicked into Hell be cast!<br />
What horrors will your Consciences surprise,<br />
When you shall hear the fruitless, doleful cries<br />
Of such as are compelléd to depart<br />
Unto the place of everlasting smart!<br />
What! when you see the sparks fly out of Hell,<br />
And view the Dungeon where you are to dwell,<br />
Wherein you must eternally remain<br />
In anguish and intolerable pain!<br />
What! when your hands and feet are bound together,<br />
And you are cast into the Lake forever!<br />
Then shall you feel the truth of what you hear,<br />
That Hellish pains are more than you can bear,<br />
And that those Torments are an hundred fold<br />
More terrible than ever you were told.</p>
<p>Nor speak I this, good Reader, to torment thee<br />
Before the time, but rather to prevent thee<br />
From running headlong to thine own decay,<br />
In such a perilous and deadly way.<br />
We who have known and felt Jehovah’s terrors,<br />
Persuade men to repent them of their errors.<br />
And turn to God in time ere his Decree<br />
Bring forth, and then there be no Remedy.<br />
If in the night, when thou art fast asleep,<br />
Some friend of thine that better watch doth keep,<br />
Should see thy house all on a burning flame,<br />
And thee almost inclosed with the same:<br />
If such a friend should break thy door and wake thee,<br />
Or else by force out of the peril take thee,<br />
What! wouldst thou take his kindness in ill part,<br />
Or frown upon him for his good desert?</p>
<p>Such, my friend, such is thy present state<br />
And danger, being unregenerate.<br />
Awake, awake, and then thou shalt perceive<br />
Thy peril greater than thou wilt believe.<br />
Lift up thine eyes, and see God’s wrathful ire<br />
Preparing unextinguishable fire<br />
For all that live and die impenitent.<br />
Awake, awake, Sinner, and repent,<br />
And quarrel not because I thus alarm<br />
Thy Soul, to save it from eternal harm.</p>
<p>Perhaps thou harborest such thoughts as these:<br />
“I hope I may enjoy my carnal ease<br />
A little longer, and myself refresh<br />
With those delights that gratify the flesh,<br />
And yet repent before it be too late,<br />
And get into a comfortable state.<br />
I hope I have yet many years to spend,<br />
And time enough those matters to attend,“<br />
Presumptuous heart! Is God engag’d to give<br />
A longer time to such as love to live<br />
Like Rebels still, who think to strain his Glory<br />
By wickedness, and after to be sorry?<br />
Unto thy lust shall he be made a drudge,<br />
Who thee and all ungodly men shall judge?<br />
Canst thou account sin sweet, and yet confess<br />
That first or last it ends in bitterness?<br />
Is sin a thing that must procure thee sorrow,<br />
And wouldst thou dally with’t another morrow?</p>
<p>O foolish man who lovest to enjoy<br />
That which will thee distress, or else destroy!<br />
What gainéd Samson by his Delilah?<br />
What gainéd David by his Bathshebah?<br />
The one became a slave, lost both his eyes,<br />
And made them sport that were his enemies;<br />
The other penneth, as a certain token<br />
Of God’s displeasure, that his bones were broken,<br />
Besides the woes he after met withal.<br />
To chasten him for that his grievous Fall:<br />
His own Son Ammon, using crafty wiles,<br />
His Daughter Thamar wickedly defiles:<br />
His second Son, more beautiful than good.<br />
His hands embreweth in his Brother’s blood:<br />
And by and by, aspiring to the Crown,<br />
He strives to pull his gentle Father down;<br />
With hellish rage, him fiercely persecuting,<br />
And brutishly his Concubines polluting.<br />
Read whoso list, and ponder what he reads,<br />
And he shall find small joy in evil deeds.</p>
<p>Moreover this consider, that the longer<br />
Thou liv’st in sin, thy sins will grow the stronger;<br />
And then it will an harder matter prove<br />
To leave those wicked haunts that thou dost love.<br />
The Black’moor may as eas’ly change his skin,<br />
As old Transgressors leave their wonted sin.<br />
And who can tell what will become of thee,<br />
Or where thy Soul in one day’s time may be?<br />
We see that Death ne’er old nor young men spares,<br />
But one and other takes at unawares;<br />
For in a moment, whilst men Peace do cry,<br />
Destruction seizeth on them suddenly.<br />
Thou who this morning art a lively wight,<br />
May’st be a corpse and damnéd Ghost ere night.</p>
<p>Oh! dream not then that it will serve thy turn<br />
Upon thy Death-bed for thy sins to mourn;<br />
But think how many have been snatch’d away,<br />
And had no time for mercy once to pray.<br />
It’s just with God Repentance to deny<br />
To such as put it off until they die.<br />
And late Repentance seldom proveth true,<br />
Which, if it fail, thou know’st what must ensue;<br />
For after this short life is at an end,<br />
What is amiss thou never canst amend.<br />
Believe, man, that to procrastinate,<br />
And put it off until it be too late,<br />
As ’tis thy sin, so it is Satan’s wile,<br />
Whereby he doth great multitudes beguile.<br />
How many thousands hath this strong delusion<br />
Already brought to ruin and confusion,<br />
Whose souls are now reserv’d in iron chains,<br />
Under thick darkness to Eternal Pains!<br />
They thought of many years, as thou dost now,<br />
But were deceivéd quite, and so may’st thou.</p>
<p>Oh! then, my friend, waste not away thy time,<br />
Nor by rebellion aggravate thy crime.<br />
Oh! put not off Repentance till to-morrow,<br />
Adventure not, without God’s leave, to borrow<br />
Another day to spend upon thy lust,<br />
Lest God (that is most Holy, Wise, and Just)<br />
Denounce in wrath, and to thy terror say,<br />
“This night shall Devils fetch thy Soul away.”</p>
<p>Now seek the face of God with all thy heart,<br />
Acknowledge unto him how vile thou art.<br />
Tell him thy Sins deserve eternal wrath,<br />
And that it is a wonder that he hath<br />
Permitted thee so long to draw thy breath,<br />
Who might have cut thee off by sudden death,<br />
And sent thy Soul into the lowest Pit,<br />
From whence no price should ever ransom it;<br />
And that he may most justly do it still,<br />
(Because thou hast deserv’d it) if he will.<br />
Yet also tell him that, if he shall please,<br />
He can forgive thy sins and thee release,<br />
And that in Christ his Son he may be just<br />
And justify all those that on him trust;<br />
That though thy sins are of a crimson dye.<br />
Yet Christ his Blood can cleanse thee thoroughly.<br />
Tell him that he may make his Glorious Name<br />
More wonderful by covering thy shame;<br />
That Mercy may be greatly magnified,<br />
And justice also fully satisfied.<br />
If he shall please to own thee in his Son,<br />
Who hath paid dear for Man’s Redempti-on.<br />
Tell him thouh hast an unbelieving heart,<br />
Which hind’reth thee from coming for a part<br />
In Christ; and that although his terrors awe thee,<br />
Thou canst not come till he be pleas’d to draw thee.<br />
Tell him thou know’st thine heart to be so bad,<br />
And thy condition so exceeding sad,<br />
That though Salvation may be had for naught<br />
Thou canst not come and take it till thou’rt brought.</p>
<p>Oh! beg of him to bow thy stubborn will<br />
To come to Christ, that he thy lusts may kill.<br />
Look up to Christ for his attractive pow’r,<br />
Which he exerteth in a needful hour;<br />
Who saith, “When as I lifted up shall be,<br />
Then will I draw all sorts of men to me.“<br />
Oh! wait upon him with true diligence<br />
And trembling fear in every Ordinance;<br />
Unto his Call earnest attention give,<br />
Whose voice makes deaf men hear and dead men live.<br />
Thus weep and mourn, thus hearken, pray, and wait,<br />
Till he behold and pity thine estate,<br />
Who is more ready to bestow his Grace<br />
Than thou the same art willing to embrace;<br />
Yea, he hath Might enough to bring thee home,<br />
Though thou hast neither strength nor will to come.</p>
<p>If he delay to answer thy request,<br />
Know that ofttimes he doth it for the best;<br />
Not with intent to drive us from his door,<br />
But for to make us importune him more;<br />
Or else to bring us daily to confess,<br />
And be convinc’d of our unworthiness.<br />
Oh! be not weary, then, but persevere<br />
To beg his Grace till he thy suit shall hear;<br />
And leave him not, nor from his footstool go,<br />
Till over thee Compassion’s skirt he throw.<br />
Eternal Life shall recompense thy pains,<br />
If found at last, with everlasting gains.<br />
For if the Lord be pleas’d to hear thy cries,<br />
And to forgive thy great iniquities,<br />
Thou wilt have cause forever to admire<br />
And laud his Grace, that granted thy desire.<br />
Then shalt thou find thy labor is not lost,<br />
But that the good obtain’d surmounts the cost.<br />
Nor shalt thou grieve for loss of sinful pleasures,<br />
Exchang’d for Heav’nly joys and lasting treasures.<br />
The yoke of Christ which once thou didst esteem<br />
A tedious yoke, shall then most easy seem.<br />
For why? The love of Christ shall thee constrain<br />
To take delight in that which was thy pain.<br />
The ways of Wisdom shall be pleasant ways,<br />
And thou shalt choose therein to spend thy days.</p>
<p>If once thy Soul be brought to such a pass,<br />
O bless the Lord and magnify his Grace.<br />
Thou that of late hadst reason to be sad,<br />
May’st now rejoice and be exceeding glad;<br />
For thy condition is as happy now<br />
As erst it was disconsolate and low.<br />
Thou art become as rich, as whilom poor;<br />
As blesséd now as curséd heretofore.<br />
For being cleanséd with Christ’s precious Blood,<br />
Thou hast an int’rest in the chiefest Good;<br />
God’s anger is towards thy Soul appeas’d,<br />
And in his Christ he is with thee well pleas’d.<br />
Yea, he doth look upon thee with a mild<br />
And gracious aspect, as upon his child.<br />
He is become thy Father and thy Friend,<br />
And will defend thee from the curséd Fiend.<br />
Thou need’st not fear the roaring Lion’s rage,<br />
Since God Almighty doth himself engage<br />
To bear thy Soul in everlasting Arms,<br />
Above the reach of all destructive harms.<br />
Whatever here thy sufferings may be,<br />
Yet from them all the Lord shall rescue thee.<br />
He will preserve thee by his wond’rous Might<br />
Unto that rich Inheritance in Light.</p>
<p>O sing for joy, all ye Regenerate,<br />
Whom Christ hath brought unto this blessed state!<br />
O love the Lord all ye his saints, who hath<br />
Redeeméd you from everlasting wrath!<br />
Who hath by dying made your Souls to live,<br />
And what he dearly bought doth freely give.<br />
Give up yourselves to walk in all his ways,<br />
And study how to live unto his praise.<br />
The time is short you have to serve him here;<br />
The day of your deliv’rance draweth near.<br />
Lift up your heads, ye upright ones in heart,<br />
Who in Christ’s purchase have obtain’d a part.<br />
Behold he rides upon a shining cloud,<br />
With angel’s voice and Trumpet sounding loud.<br />
He comes to save his folk from all their foes,<br />
And plague the men that Holiness oppose.<br />
So come, Lord Jesus, quickly come, we pray;<br />
Yea, come and hasten our Redemption-day.</p>
<h2 id="vanity-of-vanities.">Vanity of Vanities.</h2>
<p><strong>A SONG OF EMPTINESS.</strong></p>
<p>Vain, frail, sliort-liv’d, and miserable Man,<br />
Learn what tliou art wlien thy estate is best;<br />
A restless Wave o’ th’ troubled Oce-an,<br />
A Dream, a lifeless Picture finely drest.</p>
<p>A Wind, a Flower, a Vapor, and a Bubble,<br />
A Wheel that stands not still, a trembling Reed,<br />
A trolling Stone, dry Dust, light Chaff, and Stubble,<br />
A shadow of something but truly naught indeed.</p>
<p>Learn what deceitful Toys and empty things<br />
This World and all its best Enjoyments be;<br />
Out of the Earth no true Contentment springs,<br />
But all things here are vexing Vanity.</p>
<p>For what is Beauty but a fading Flower?<br />
Or what is Pleasure but the Devil’s bait,<br />
Whereby he catcheth whom he would devour,<br />
And multitudes of Souls doth ruinate?</p>
<p>And what are Friends but mortal men as we,<br />
Whom Death from us may quickly separate?<br />
Or else their hearts may quite estrangéd be,<br />
And all their love be turnéd into hate.</p>
<p>And what are Riches to be doted on?<br />
Uncertain, fickle, and ensnaring things;<br />
They draw men’s Souls into Perditi-on,<br />
And when most needed take them to their wings.</p>
<p>Ah! foolish man! that sets his heart upon<br />
Such empty shadows, such wild Fowl as these,<br />
That being gotten will be quickly gone,<br />
And whilst they stay increase but his disease.</p>
<p>As in a Dropsy, drinking drought begets,<br />
The more he drinks the more he still requires,<br />
So on this World whoso affection sets,<br />
As Wealth’s increase, increaseth his desires.</p>
<p>O happy Man, whose portion is above,<br />
Where Floods, where Flames, where Foes cannot bereave him!<br />
Most wretched Man that fixéd hath his love<br />
Upon this World, that surely will deceive him!</p>
<p>For what is Honor? what is Sovereignty,<br />
Whereto men’s hearts so restlessly aspire?<br />
Whom have they crowned with Felicity?<br />
When did they ever satisfy desire?</p>
<p>The Ear of Man with hearing is not fill’d;<br />
To see new sights still coveteth the Eye;<br />
The craving stomach, though it may be still’d.<br />
Yet craves again without a new supply.</p>
<p>All Earthly things man’s cravings answer not,<br />
Whose little heart would all the World contain,<br />
(If all the World should fall to one man’s lot)<br />
And notwithstanding empty still remain.</p>
<p>The Eastern Conqueror was said to weep<br />
When he the Indian Oce-an did view,<br />
To see his Conquest bounded by the Deep,<br />
And no more Worlds remaining to subdue.</p>
<p>Who would that man in his Enjoyment bless,<br />
Or envy him, or covet his Estate,<br />
Whose gettings do augment his greediness.<br />
And make his wishes more intemperate?</p>
<p>Such is the wonted and the common guise<br />
Of those on Earth that bear the greatest sway;<br />
If with a few the case be otherwise,<br />
They seek a Kingdom that abides for aye.</p>
<p>Moreover they of all the Sons of Men<br />
That rule, and are in highest Places set,<br />
Are most inclin’d to scorn their Bretheren,<br />
And God himself (without great Grace) forget.</p>
<p>For as the Sun doth blind the gazers’ eyes,<br />
That for a time they naught discern aright,<br />
So Honor doth befool and blind the Wise,<br />
And their own lustre ’reaves them of their sight.</p>
<p>Great are their Dangers, manifold their Cares,<br />
Through which, whilst others sleep, they scarcely Nap,<br />
And yet are oft surprised unawares,<br />
And fall unwilling into Envy’s Trap.</p>
<p>The mean Mechanic finds his kindly rest;<br />
All void of fear sleepeth the Country Clown;<br />
When greatest Princes often are distrest,<br />
And cannot sleep upon their Beds of Down.</p>
<p>Could Strength or Valor men Immortalize,<br />
Could Wealth or Honor keep them from decay<br />
There were some cause the same to Idolize,<br />
And give the lie to that which I do say.</p>
<p>But neither can such things themselves end are,<br />
Without the hazard of a change, one hour,<br />
Nor such as trust in them can they secure<br />
From dismal days, or Death’s prevailing pow’r.</p>
<p>If Beauty could the Beautiful defend<br />
From Death’s dominion, then fair Absalom<br />
Had not been brought to such a shameful end:<br />
But fair and foul unto the Grave must come.</p>
<p>If Wealth or Scepters could Immortal make,<br />
Then, wealthy Crœsus, wherefore art thou dead?<br />
If Warlike force which makes the World to quake,<br />
Then why is Julius Caesar perishéd?</p>
<p>Where are the Scipio’s Thunderbolts of War?<br />
Renownéd Pompey, Caesar’s Enemy?<br />
Stout Hannibal, Rome’s Terror known so far?<br />
Great Alexander, what’s become of thee?</p>
<p>If Gifts and Bribes Death’s favor might but win,<br />
If Pow’r, if Force, or Threat’nings might it fray,<br />
All these, and more had still surviving been;<br />
But all are gone, for Death will have no Nay.</p>
<p>Such is this World, with all her Pomp and Glory;<br />
Such are the men whom worldly eyes admire,<br />
Cut down by time, and now become a Story,<br />
That we might after better things aspire.</p>
<p>Go boast thyself of what thy heart enjoys,<br />
Vain Man! triumph in all thy worldly Bliss:<br />
Thy best Enjoyments are but Trash and Toys;<br />
Delight thyself in that which worthless is.</p>

<p>Welcome good Angels, who, for me distrest,<br />

<h2 id="a-farewell-to-the-world.">A Farewell to the World.</h2>
<p>Now Farewell, World, in which is not my Treasure;<br />
I have in thee enjoy’d but little Pleasure.<br />
And now I leave thee for a Better Place,<br />
Where lasting Pleasures are, before Christ’s face.</p>
<p>Farewell, ye Sons of Men, who do not savor<br />
The things of God; who little prize his Favor.<br />
Farewell, I say, with your Fool’s Paradise,<br />
Until the King of Terrors you surprise,<br />
And bring you trembling to Christ’s Judgment Seat,<br />
To give Account of your Transgressions great.</p>
<p>Farewell, New England, which hast long enjoy’d<br />
The Day of Grace, but hast most vainly toy’d<br />
And trifled with the Gospel’s glorious Light;<br />
Thou may’st expect a dark Egyptian Night.</p>
<p>Farewell, young Brood and rising Generation,<br />
Wanton and proud, ripe for God’s Indignation,<br />
Which neither you nor others can prevent,<br />
Except in Truth you speedily repent.</p>
<p>Farewell, sweet Saints of God, Christ’s little Number,<br />
Beware lest ye through sloth securely slumber;<br />
Stand to your Spir’tual Arms and keep your Watch,<br />
Let not your Enemy you napping catch;<br />
Take up your Cross, prepare for Tribulation,<br />
Through which doth lie the way unto salvation.</p>
<p>Love Jesus Christ with all sincerity;<br />
Eschew Will-worship and Idolatry.<br />
Farewell, again, until we all appear<br />
Before our Lord, a <em>Well-done</em> there to hear.</p>
<p>Farewell, ye faithful Servants of the Lord,<br />
Painful dispensers of his Holy Word,<br />
From whose Communion and Society<br />
I once was kept through long infirmity.<br />
This of my Sorrows was an aggravation;<br />
But Christ be thankéd, through whose Mediation<br />
I have at length obtainéd Liberty<br />
To dwell with Soul-delighting Company,<br />
Where many of our Friends are gone before,<br />
And you shall follow with a many more.<br />
Meanwhile stand fast, the Truth of God maintain,<br />
Suffer for Christ, and great shall be your Gain.</p>
<p>Farewell, my natural Friends and dear Relations,<br />
Who have my Trials seen and great Temptations;<br />
You have no cause to make for me great Moan;<br />
My Death to you is little Loss or none.<br />
But unto me it is no little Gain,<br />
For Death at once frees me from all my Pain.<br />
Make Christ your greatest Friend, who never dies;<br />
All other Friends are fading Vanities.<br />
Make him your Light, your Life, your End, your All;<br />
Prepare for Death, be ready for his Call.</p>
<p>Farewell, vile Body, subject to decay.<br />
Which art with lingering sickness worn away;<br />
I have by thee much Pain and Smart endur’d;<br />
Great Grief of Mind hast thou to me procur’d;<br />
Great Grief of Mind by being Impotent,<br />
And to Christ’s Work an awkward Instrument.<br />
Thou shalt not henceforth be a clog to me.<br />
Nor shall my Soul a Burthen be to thee.</p>
<p>Rest in thy Grave until the Resurrection,<br />
Then shalt thou be revivéd in Perfection,<br />
Endow’d with wonderful Agility,<br />
Clothéd with Strength and Immortality;<br />
With shining Brightness gloriously array’d,<br />
Like to Christ’s glorious Body, glorious made.<br />
Thus Christ shall thee again to me restore,<br />
Ever to live with him and part no more.<br />
Meanwhile my Soul shall enter into Peace,<br />
Where Fears and Tears, where Sin and Smart shall cease.</p>
<h2 id="a-character-of-the-reverend-author-mr.michael-wigglesworth-in-a-funeral-sermon-preached-at-malden-june-24-1705.-by-the-reverend-dr.cotton-mather.">A Character of the Reverend Author, Mr. Michael Wigglesworth, in a Funeral Sermon Preached at Malden, June 24, 1705. By the Reverend Dr. Cotton Mather.</h2>
<p>He was Descended of Eminently Religious Parents, who were Sufferers for that which was then <em>The Cause of God</em> and of <em>New-England</em>. While he was yet a youth, he was marvellously concerned that he might have an Heart filled with the Spirit of God. This Concernment upon his mind appeared especially in his watchful Endeavors to have <em>Spiritual Sins</em> chased out of his cleansed Heart. Pride, the Sin of <em>Young Men</em>, yea, of <em>all</em> Men; Pride, the Sin which few Men try or trouble themselves about; this Devout Youth was full of Holy and Watchful Trouble about it: And he then wrote a very Savoury Discourse, Entituled, <em>Considerations against Pride</em>, and another, Entituled, <em>Considerations against Delighting more in the Creature than in God</em>. This was to Mortify in himself the Sins rarely minded by the most of men.</p>
<p>Having had a Pious and a Learned Education, the first Publick Station wherein I find him, was that of a <em>Fellow</em> and a <em>Tutor</em> in <em>Harvard Colledge</em>. With a rare Faithfulness did he adorn that Station! He used all means imaginable to make his <em>Pupils</em> not only good Scholars, but also good <em>Christians</em>, and instil into them those things which might render them rich Blessings unto the <em>Churches</em> of God. Unto his Watchful and Painful Essays to keep them close under their <em>Academical Exercises</em> he added Serious Admonitions unto them about their Interior State; and he Employed his <em>Prayers</em> and <em>Tears</em> to God for them, and had such a flaming zeal to make them worthy Men, that upon Reflection he was afraid <em>Lest his cares for their Good, and his affection to them, should so drink up his very Spirit, as to steal away his Heart from God.</em></p>
<p>From <em>Cambridge</em> he made his remove to <em>Malden</em>, and was their Faithful Pastor for about a Jubilee of years together.</p>
<p>It was not long after his coming to Maiden that a sickly Constitution so prevailed upon him, as to confine him from his Publick Work for some whole seven of Years. His <em>Faithfulness</em> continued when his <em>Ministry</em> was thus interrupted. The Kindness of his Tender Flock unto him was answered in his Kind Concern to have them served by other Hands. He took a short voyage unto another Country for the Recovery of his Health; which, though he recovered not, yet at his Return I find him comforting himself with inserting of this Passage in his Reserved Papers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Peradventure the Lord Removed me for a season that he might set a better Watchman over his Flock, and a more painful Laborer in his Vineyard. This was one thing that I aimed at in Removing (to help the People’s Modesty in the case), and I believe the Lord aimed at it, in Removing me for a season.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His Faithfulness now appeared in his <em>Edifying Discourses</em> to those that came near him; much bewailing the want of a Profitable and Religious conversation in so many that profess Religion. And that yet he might more <em>Faithfully</em> set himself to do Good, when he could not Preach he <em>Wrote</em> several Composures, wherein he proposed the edification of such Readers as are for plain Truths, dressed up in <em>a Plain Meeter</em>. These Composures have had their Acceptance and Advantage among that sort of Readers; and one of them, the <em>Day of Doom</em>, which has been often Reprinted in both Englands, may find our Children till the Day itself arrive.</p>
<p>It pleased God, when the distress of the Church in <em>Malden</em> did extremely call for it, wondrously to restore his <em>Faithful Servant</em>. He that had been for near Twenty Years almost <em>Buried Alive</em>, comes abroad again, and for as many years more, must, in <em>Publick Usefulness</em>, receive the Answer and Harvest of the Thousands of Supplications with which the God of his Health had favoured him.</p>
<p>How <em>Faithfully</em> did he now Deliver the <em>Whole Counsel of God!</em></p>
<p>How <em>Faithfully</em> did he Rebuke <em>Sin</em>, both in his <em>Ministry</em> and <em>Discipline!</em></p>
<p>How Faithful was he to the <em>Work of God</em> in the Churches of <em>New-England</em>, and grieved at every thing that he thought had any Tendency to incommode that Glorious Work! But how <em>Patient</em>, how <em>Loving</em>, how <em>Charitable</em> to such as in lesser Matters differed from him!</p>
<p>How Faithful was he in the Education of his <em>Family</em>! A very Abraham for his Commands unto them, to <em>Keep the Way of the Lord!</em> A very David for his charge unto them to <em>Know the God of their Father and Serve Him!</em></p>
<p>His long Weakness and Illness made him an <em>able Physician</em> for the <em>Body</em> as well the <em>Soul</em>.</p>
<p>As he was <em>Faithful to the Death</em>, so he was <em>Lively to the Death.</em></p>
<p>It was a surprise to us to see a little, feeble <em>Shadow of a Man</em>, beyond <em>Seventy</em>, Preaching usually twice or thrice in a week, Visiting, Comforting the <em>Afflicted</em>, Encouraging the <em>Private Meetings</em>, <em>Catechising</em> the Children of the Flock, and managing the <em>Government</em> of the Church, and attending the <em>Sick</em>, not only as a <em>Pastor</em>, but as a <em>Physician</em> too; and this not only in his own Town, but also in all those of the Vicinity. Thus he did <em>unto the Last</em>; and he was but one <em>Lord’s-Day</em> taken off before his Last. But in the <em>Last Week</em> of his Life, how full of <em>Resignation!</em> How full of <em>Satisfaction!</em></p>
<p>From his Exemplary Life I will single out one thing, his EARLY RELIGION. Our <em>Wigglesworth</em> was a Godly child, and he held on living to God and Christ until the Seventy-Fourth Year of his Age.</p>
<p>When he lay a Dying, some one spoke to him about his having secured his <em>Interest</em> in the Favor of Heaven, and his <em>Assurance</em> of that Interest. He Replyed, [Methoughts like my <em>Polycarp,</em>]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I bless God I began that Work betimes, and ere I was Twenty Years Old I had made thorow work of it. Ever since then I have been pressing after the Power of Godliness, the Power of Godliness! For more than Fifty Years together I have been Laboring to uphold a Life of Communion with God; and I thank the Lord I now find the Comfort of it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Words that contain in them <em>A History of a Life</em> more Valuable than I have seen a Volume in Folio.</p>

<p>His Pen did once <em>Meat from the Eater</em> fetch;<br />
And now he’s gone beyond the <em>Eater’s</em> reach.<br />
His <em>Body</em> once so <em>Thin</em>, was next to <em>None</em>;<br />
From hence he’s to <em>Unbodied Spirits</em> flown.<br />
Once his rare skill did all <em>Diseases</em> heal;<br />
And he does nothing now <em>uneasy</em> feel.<br />
He to his <em>Paradise</em> is joyful come,<br />
And waits with joy to see his <em>Day of Doom.</em></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
